# Slide 1
**The word aerospace is essentially a combination of two words:** aeronautics **and** spaceflight. **Therefore, aerospace deals with the design, manufacturing, and maintenance of aircrafts or spacecrafts and can be thought of as the science of flight within Earth’s atmosphere as well as outside it.**

Aerospace **can be further divided in:**
- Aeronautics:  **it is basically all things aeroplane-related within Earth’s atmosphere.**
- Astronautics: **it is basically all things aeroplane-related outside Earth’s atmosphere.**
- Aviation: **the operational aspects of the aircraft**

# Slide 2
**The evolution of the aerospace engineering systems involves upgrades and updates on**
- Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance (CNS) systems of aircraft
- Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) systems for air vehicles

**For both, the aeronautical community is looking for more intelligent aerospace systems where autonomy plays a key role to keep air transportation safe and secure.**

# Slide 3
**An example system may follow a three-layered architecture.**
1. **The top layer, also called the** decision layer, **consists of a domain model and a search engine**.
    - **The domain model lists the** constraints that describe the relationships between elements of the system **(which may include environmental constraints)** and the flight rules that need to be followed during planning.
    - **The search engine** does the actual planning, **i.e., it elaborates and scheduled activities to meet a given goal under the constraints described in the domain model.**

    **The output of the decision layer is a plan**
2. **The middle layer, also called the executive**, takes a plan and "executes" it by issuing commands to the controllers in the bottom layer, **also called functional layer. The executive is responsible for issuing commands, checking that commands are actually executed, and responding to exception signals generated by the controllers.**
3. **The functional layer** is a collection of controllers that actually command the hardware devices of the physical system. **This is the lowest level of an autonomy software system.**

**The architecture also needs to support reconfiguration, not only in terms of adding, removing, or changing components in the functional layer, but also in terms of adding planning and execution capabilities.**

# Slide 4
Verification is one of the most challenging issue for IA **no matter the domain unmanned systems are coming from.**

The problem is that a truly intelligent and autonomous system can have too many combinations of different output(s) for the same input(s). This makes very difficult the generation of all the possible combinations for the above inputs and outputs. **Additionally, it can have the different outputs for the same set of inputs which makes IA behavior tough to predict.**

In order to have a robust architecture, every component in the autonomous system built with the architecture must be verified.

From a Verification and validation (V&V) point of view, each element requires different techniques, even though some basic techniques (such as code analysis) can be applied across the board
- The functional layer, containing the control software, is the closest to traditional embedded software systems. It mostly consists of control device drivers for actuators or sensors as well as mathematical and algorithmic libraries. For these elements, we are mostly concerned with certifying that they cannot crash (regardless of their inputs) and assessing their performance in terms of execution time and memory management. This suggests that a V&V approach based on embedded system verification can be applied in a straightforward manner.
